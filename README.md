# G13 Profiles

My Logitech G13 Gamepad profiles.

## Profiles

Profiles Available:

- `default.xml`: Has my WoW bindings.
- `wow.xml`: Also has my WoW bindings. (I don't use this gamepad for anything else.) I can't
  remember exactly, but I think sometimes the Default profile gets reset to the default bindings, so
  having this too is a good backup.

## Importing

In the Logitech Gaming Software, click on the folder icon, then "Import", the select one of the XML profiles in this repo under the `profiles/` directory..

Right click on a profiles, click "Export", then choose a save path, such as this repo's `profiles/`
directory.

## Installation of Logitech Gaming Software

Because this is a discontinued product, I have archived the installer here in this repo's Releases.
Specifically, it's [this
one](https://github.com/t-mart/g13-profiles/releases/tag/logitech-gaming-software).
